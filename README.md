# luaztls
Lua binding for ZeroMQ TLS proxy with mbedtls library

This project allows you to interconnect ZeroMQ network stack with SSL/TLS enabled services e.g.: https, imaps, pop3s, ...

## Requirements

You'll need to use ZeroMQ PAIR socket type to send/receive data over TLS.

See my other project LuaZMQ at https://github.com/soulik/luazmq

## Usage

You should include following line somewhere in your Lua code:

```lua
local ztls = require 'ztls'
```

> Be sure to read incomming data in large enough chunks or you might lose some data. It's usually good to use chunks with size of 8KB.

## API

* Initialization

  Initializes and returns ZTLS context object.

  * **zeromq_ctx** - ZeroMQ context object (needed only for IPC/Inproc transport)
  * **data_endpoint** - used to transport unencrypted communication data
  * **control_endpoint** - used for debugging purposes, may contain info/error messages (not mandatory parameter)

  ``ztls_ctx = ztls.client(data_endpoint, control_endpoint)``

  ``ztls_ctx = ztls.client(zeromq_ctx, data_endpoint, control_endpoint)``

* Connection

  Connects to remote server and initializes TLS connection.
  
  * **host** - Remote hostname/IPv4/IPv6
  * **port** - Port number
  
  ``ztls_ctx.connect(host, port)``
  
  ``ztls_ctx.close()``

## Examples

Following example connects to well known website and grabs its content.

```lua
local zmq = require 'zmq'
local ztls = require 'ztls'

local function test_https(host, url)
    local CHUNK_SIZE = 8192
	local data_endpoint = 'inproc://https'
	local ctx = zmq.context()
	local tlsClient = assert(ztls.client(ctx, data_endpoint))

	local s = assert(ctx.socket(zmq.ZMQ_PAIR))

	assert(s.connect(data_endpoint))

	local request = ("GET %s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: %s\r\n\r\n"):format(url, host)

	tlsClient.connect(host, 443)

	local len = assert(s.send(request))
	if len and len > 0 then
		local poll = zmq.poll {
			{s, zmq.ZMQ_POLLIN, function(s)
				local result = assert(s.recv(CHUNK_SIZE))
				print(result)
			end},
		}
		poll.start()
	end

	tlsClient.close()
end

test_https('google.com', '/')
```
